                  Avoid stress:A variety of factors, including work, education,
                  family life, or relationships, can cause stress. It is
                  important to try managing and addressing these stressful
                  situations when they arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Exercise:High-intensity exercise releases the feel-good
                  chemicals, known as endorphins, into the body.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Low-intensity exercise sustained over an extended period helps
                  release proteins called neurotrophic factors, which improve
                  brain function and make a person who is exercising feel
                  better.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Many people who are depressed have low motivation for
                  exercise, so it is a good idea to start with 5 minutes of
                  walking or doing an enjoyable activity and gradually increase
                  the length of time over the coming days, weeks, and months.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Avoid alcohol and drugs:There is a close link between
                  depression, as well as anxiety disorders, and alcohol or other
                  substance-use disorders.

                <h1>You are experiencing situational depression</h1>
                <p>
                  You should see a doctor if your symptoms are making it
                  difficult for you to take care of your everyday
                  responsibilities and activities. Treatment can help you better
                  cope with stressful events. Treatment includes medications but
                  make sure it is a doctor prescribing it for you
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, supportive psychotherapy is generally the preferred
                  treatment for situational depression as the treatment can help
                  enhance coping mechanisms and resilience. This is important
                  because it can help you cope with future challenges and
                  potentially avoid future bouts of situational depression. One
                  type of therapy that may help is cognitive behavioral therapy
                  (CBT).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once treatment is helping you address your depression, you can
                  also make some lifestyle changes that can help you cope. These
                  include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>getting exercise</li>
                  <li>establishing healthy sleeping habits</li>
                  <li>getting more rest and relaxation</li>
                  <li>
                    eating more healthfully
                  </li>
                  <li>strengthening your social support system</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>You are Psychotically depressed</h1>
                <p>
                  Dont fret. A person who receives treatment for psychotic
                  depression can be back to their normal self in a couple of
                  months.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are two modalities of treatment for psychotic
                  depression, Dr. Rothschild says. “The combination of an
                  antidepressant with an antipsychotic is one, and
                  electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the other,” he says. “That
                  is a decision to make with the family and it depends on the
                  situation.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  In some older patients, ECT may be used in order to avoid the
                  side effects of medication. Sometimes a course of ECT is
                  prescribed and then the antidepressant and antipsychotic are
                  taken afterward. Talk therapy can be helpful, too, he says,
                  but only after the first line treatment of medication or ECT
                  has been started, Dr. Rothschild says.

                <p>
                  The most helpful treatment is a combination of psychotherapy
                  and medication.Medication should be prescibed by a medical
                  professional
                </p>
                <p>
                  It usually takes at least two to six weeks of taking any
                  antidepressant to see improvement. It may take several trials
                  to find the medication that works best. Once the right
                  medication is found, it may take up to a few months to find a
                  proper dose and for the full positive effect to be seen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A number of psychotherapy techniques have been demonstrated to
                  be helpful, depending on the causes of the depression, the
                  availability of family and other social support, and personal
                  style and preference. A technique called cognitive behavioral
                  therapy is designed to help a depressed person recognize
                  negative thinking and teaches techniques for controlling
                  symptoms. Psychodynamic, insight-oriented or interpersonal
                  psychotherapy can help depressed people to sort out conflicts
                  in important relationships or explore the history behind
                  symptoms
                </p>
                <p>
                  In some situations, a treatment called electroconvulsive
                  therapy (ECT) can be a life-saving option. This treatment is
                  controversial, but very effective. In ECT, an electrical
                  impulse is applied to the person's scalp and passes to the
                  brain, causing a seizure. The patient is under anesthesia and
                  is monitored carefully. Medication is given before the
                  procedure to prevent any outward signs of convulsions, which
                  helps to prevent injury. Improvement is seen gradually over a
                  period of days to weeks after the treatment. ECT is the
                  quickest and most effective treatment for the most severe
                  forms of depression, and in most people, it is not more risky
                  than other antidepressant treatments.
