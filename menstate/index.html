              Avoid stress:A variety of factors, including work, education,
              family life, or relationships, can cause stress. It is important
              to try managing and addressing these stressful situations when
              they arise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Exercise:High-intensity exercise releases the feel-good chemicals,
              known as endorphins, into the body.
            </p>
            <p>
              Low-intensity exercise sustained over an extended period helps
              release proteins called neurotrophic factors, which improve brain
              function and make a person who is exercising feel better.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people who are depressed have low motivation for exercise, so
              it is a good idea to start with 5 minutes of walking or doing an
              enjoyable activity and gradually increase the length of time over
              the coming days, weeks, and months.
            </p>
            <p>
              Avoid alcohol and drugs:There is a close link between depression,
              as well as anxiety disorders, and alcohol or other substance-use
              disorders.

            <h1>You are experiencing situational depression</h1>
            <p>
              You should see a doctor if your symptoms are making it difficult
              for you to take care of your everyday responsibilities and
              activities. Treatment can help you better cope with stressful
              events. Treatment includes medications but make sure it is a
              doctor prescribing it for you
            </p>
            <p>
              However, supportive psychotherapy is generally the preferred
              treatment for situational depression as the treatment can help
              enhance coping mechanisms and resilience. This is important
              because it can help you cope with future challenges and
              potentially avoid future bouts of situational depression. One type
              of therapy that may help is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
            </p>
            <p>
              Once treatment is helping you address your depression, you can
              also make some lifestyle changes that can help you cope. These
              include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>getting exercise</li>
              <li>establishing healthy sleeping habits</li>
              <li>getting more rest and relaxation</li>
              <li>
                eating more healthfully
              </li>
              <li>strengthening your social support system</li>
            </ul>

          <div id="psyc">
            <h1>You are Psychotically depressed</h1>
            <p>
              Dont fret. A person who receives treatment for psychotic
              depression can be back to their normal self in a couple of months.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two modalities of treatment for psychotic depression,
              Dr. Rothschild says. “The combination of an antidepressant with an
              antipsychotic is one, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the
              other,” he says. “That is a decision to make with the family and
              it depends on the situation.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In some older patients, ECT may be used in order to avoid the side
              effects of medication. Sometimes a course of ECT is prescribed and
              then the antidepressant and antipsychotic are taken afterward.
              Talk therapy can be helpful, too, he says, but only after the
              first line treatment of medication or ECT has been started, Dr.
              Rothschild says.

          <div id="major">
            <h1>You are experiencing Major depression</h1>
            <p>
              The most helpful treatment is a combination of psychotherapy and
              medication.Medication should be prescibed by a medical
              professional
            </p>
            <p>
              It usually takes at least two to six weeks of taking any
              antidepressant to see improvement. It may take several trials to
              find the medication that works best. Once the right medication is
              found, it may take up to a few months to find a proper dose and
              for the full positive effect to be seen.
            </p>
            <p>
              A number of psychotherapy techniques have been demonstrated to be
              helpful, depending on the causes of the depression, the
              availability of family and other social support, and personal
              style and preference. A technique called cognitive behavioral
              therapy is designed to help a depressed person recognize negative
              thinking and teaches techniques for controlling symptoms.
              Psychodynamic, insight-oriented or interpersonal psychotherapy can
              help depressed people to sort out conflicts in important
              relationships or explore the history behind symptoms
            </p>
            <p>
              In some situations, a treatment called electroconvulsive therapy
              (ECT) can be a life-saving option. This treatment is
              controversial, but very effective. In ECT, an electrical impulse
              is applied to the person's scalp and passes to the brain, causing
              a seizure. The patient is under anesthesia and is monitored
              carefully. Medication is given before the procedure to prevent any
              outward signs of convulsions, which helps to prevent injury.
              Improvement is seen gradually over a period of days to weeks after
              the treatment. ECT is the quickest and most effective treatment
              for the most severe forms of depression, and in most people, it is
              not more risky than other antidepressant treatments.
